# XLS: Accelerator Synthesis

# The group of known users of XLS.
# The targets listed with this visibility comprise the intended "public API" of
# XLS, and are be supported and are "reasonably" stable, i.e., significant
# changes are expected to be rare and coordinated.
# Ultimately, this is where all non-XLS-internal users should be listed, once
# the transition described in the TODOs below are complete.

# TODO(leary): 2020-06-29 This structure is a work-around to publically expose
# XLS APIs. Once the public XLS API is determined, those packages should be
# explicitly marked with 'xls_public' visibility, and this should be changed so
# that 'xls_public' includes 'xls_internal' and not vice versa.

# Users of various XLS utility helpers, e.g. things like logging, testing
# targets. Some of these will likely be eliminated when logging is
# no longer XLS specific.

# We call this out to distinguish it from properly public headers that expose
# fundamental XLS functionality.

# "Best effort" users are ones that are using some XLS internals
# (ideally temporarily) and are agreeing to be broken at any
# time if we can't figure out how to fix them, since we need to
# be able to evolve XLS innards as necessary.
