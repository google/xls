As projects cut releases or freeze, it's important to know that
generated (e.g. Verilog) code is never changing without having to
actually check in the generated artifact. This rule performs a checksum
of a generated file as an integrity check. Users might use this rule to
help enable confidence that there is neither:

*   non-determinism in the toolchain, nor
*   an accidental dependence on a non-released toolchain (e.g. an
    accidental dependence on top-of-tree, where the toolchain is
    constantly changing)

Say there was a codegen rule producing `my_output.v`, a user might instantiate
something like:

```
check_sha256sum_frozen(
    name = "my_output_checksum",
    src = ":my_output.v",
    sha256sum = "d1bc8d3ba4afc7e109612cb73acbdddac052c93025aa1f82942edabb7deb82a1",
    frozen_file = "my_output.frozen.x",
)
```

... and then take a dependency on `my_output.frozen.v` in the
surrounding project, knowing that it had been checksum-verified.

Taking a dependence on `my_output.v` directly may also be ok if the
`:my_output_checksum` target is also built (e.g. via the same wildcard
build request), but taking a dependence on the output `.frozen.v` file
ensures that the checking is an integral part of the downstream
build-artifact-creation process.

At its core, this rule ensure that the contents of a file does not
change by verifying that it matches a given checksum. Typically, this
rule is used to control the build process. The rule serves as a trigger
on rules depending on its output (the frozen file). When the validation
of the sha256sum succeed, rules depending on the frozen file are
built/executed. When the validation of the sha256sum fails, rules
depending on the frozen file are not built/executed.

In the example below, when the validation of the sha256sum for
target 'generated_file_sha256sum_frozen' succeeds, target
'generated_file_dslx' is built. However, when the validation of the
sha256sum for target 'generated_file_sha256sum_frozen' fails, target
'generated_file_dslx' is not built.
