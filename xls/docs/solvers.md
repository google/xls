# XLS Solvers

Programs that are represented as optimized XLS IR are converted into circuits
based on boolean logic, and so it is also possible to feed those as logical
operations to a theorem prover.

We have implemented that conversion with the Z3 theorem prover using its "bit
vector" type support. As a result, you can conceptually ask Z3 to prove any
predicate that can be expressed as XLS, over all possible parameter inputs.

See the [tools documentation](https://github.com/google/xls/tree/main/xls/g3doc/tools.md)
for usage information on related command line tools.

## Applications

This facility is expected to be useful to augment random testing. While
profiling the values in an XLS IR function that is given random stimulus, we may
observe bits that result from nodes that *appear* to be constant (but are not
created via a "literal" or a "concat" of a literal).

**Example:** Say the value resulting from `and.1234` in the graph appears to be
constant zero with all the stimulus provided via a fuzzer thus far -- the solver
provides a facility whereby we can ask "is there a counterexample to `and.1234`
always being zero?" and the solver will either say "no, it is always zero", or
it will yield a counterexample, or will not terminate within the allocated
deadline.

Assuming we can prove useful properties in a reasonable amount of time, we can
use this proof capability to help find interesting example inputs that provide
unique stimulus.

### Correctness WRT reference: [32-bit Floating-Point Adder](https://github.com/google/xls/tree/main/xls/modules/fpadd_2x32.x)

The full input space for a 32-bit adder is a whopping 64 bits - far more than is
possible to exhaustively test for correctness. Proving correctness via Z3,
however, is relatively straightforward: at a high level, one just compares the
output from the DSLX (translated into Z3) and comapres that to the same
operation performed solely in Z3.

In detail, the steps are:

1.  Translate the DSLX implementation into Z3 via
    `Z3Translator::CreateAndTranslate()`.
1.  Create a Z3 implementation of the same addition. This is nearly trivial, as
    Z3 helpfully has built-in support for floating-point values and theories.
1.  Take the result nodes from each "branch" above and create a new node
    subtracting the two. This is the absolute error. Note: Usually, one is
    interested in relative error when working with FP values, but here, our
    target is absolute equivalence, so absolute error sufficies (and is
    simpler).
1.  Create a Z3 node comparing that error to the maximum bound (here 0.0f).
1.  Feed that error node into a Z3 solver, asking it to prove that the error
    could be greater than that bound.

If the solver can not satisfy that criterion, then that means the error is
_never_ greater than that bound, i.e., that the implementations are equivalent
(with our 0.0f bound).

### IR Transform validity

It's usually not possible (or is merely extremely difficult) to write tests to
prove that an optimization/transform is safe across all input IR. By comparing
the optimized vs. unoptimized IR in a similar manner as the correctness proof
above, we can symbolically prove safety.

The only difference between this and the correctness proof is that both the
optimized and unoptimized IR need to be fed into the same Z3Translator (the
second via `Z3Translator::AddFunction()`) and the result nodes each are used in
the error comparison.

### IR to netlist Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC)

After a user design has been lowered to IR, it is optimized (see the previous
section), then Verilog is generated for that optimized IR. That Verilog is then
compiled by an external tool, which, if successful, will output a "netlist" - a
set of standard cells (think AND, OR, NOT, flops, etc.) and wires connecting
them that realizes the design.

Between the IR level and that netlist, many, many transformations are applied to
the design. Before processing the netlist further - and certainly before sending
the final design to fabrication - it's a very good idea to ensure that the
netlist describes the correct logic!

Demonstrating initial design correctness is up to the user, via unit tests or
integration tests at the DSLX level. At all stages below that, though, ensuring
logical equivalence between forms is XLS' responsibility. To prove equivalence
between the IR and netlist forms of a design, XLS uses formal verification via
solvers - currently only Z3, above.

Performing IR-to-netlist LEC is very similar to the checking above - the source
IR is one half of the comparison. Here, the second half is the netlist
translated into IR, which only requires a small amount of extra work. Consider
the snippet below:

```
FOO p1_and_1 ( .A(p0_i0), .B(p0_i1), .Z(p1_and_1_comb) );
BAR p1_and_2 ( .A(p0_i2), .B(p0_i3), .Z(p1_and_2_comb) );
```

These lines describe, in order:

-   One cell, called `AND`, that takes two inputs, .A and .B, provided by the
    wires `p0_i0` and `p0_i1`, respectively, and one output, .Z, which will be
    assigned to the wire `p1_and_1_comb.
-   One cell, called `OR`, that takes two inputs, .A and .B, provided by the
    wires `p0_i2` and `p0_i2`, respectively, and one output, .Z, which will be
    assigned to the wire `p1_and_2_comb.

Note that the _values_ computed by the cells wasn't mentioned - that's because
`FOO` and `BAR` are defined in the "cell library", the list of standard cells
used to generate the netlist. Thus, to be able to model these gates in a solver,
we need to take that cell library as input to the LEC tool. The netlist
describes how cells are laid out, and the cell library indicates what cells
actually `do`. With both of these in hand, preparing the netlist half of a LEC
is a [relatively] straightforward matter of parsing a netlist and cell library
and converting those together into a description of logic. See
[z3_netlist_translator.cc](https://github.com/google/xls/tree/main/xls/solvers/z3_netlist_translator.cc)
for full details.

## Current Limitations

### Time-to-result

Under the hood, Z3 (and many other tools in this space) is an (SMT
solver)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories]. At a high
level, think of an SMT solver as a SAT solver that has special handling for
certain classes of data (bit vectors, floating-point numbers). Many sufficiently
complicated problems will reduce to raw SAT solving (especially those involving
netlists, which have to implement complex logic at the gate level. Consider what
that means for a multiply, for example!). Since SAT scales exponentially with
the size of its inputs, execution time can quickly grow past a point of utility
for complex operations, notably multiplication. Fortunately, for most designs
(without such complex ops), proving equivalence of a single pipeline stage can
complete in a small amount of time (O(minutes)).

### Predicate coverage

Hypothetically, any XLS function that computes a predicate (bool) can be fed to
Z3 for satisfiability testing. Currently a more limited set of predicates are
exposed that can be easily expressed on the command line; however, it should be
possible to provide:

-   an XLS IR file
-   a set of nodes in the entry function
-   a DSLX function that computes a predicate on those nodes

Which would allow the user to compute arbitrary properties of nodes in the
function with the concise DSL syntax.

### Subroutines

Z3 doesn't intrinsically have support for subroutines, or as they're called in
Z3, "macros", instead requiring that
[all function calls be inlined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7740556/equivalent-of-define-fun-in-z3-api).

There is an extension that adds support for _recursive_ function decls and defs,
but in our experience, it doesn't behave the way we'd expect.

Consider the following example:

```
package p

fn mapper(value: bits[32]) -> bits[32] {
  ret value
}

fn main() -> bits[1] {
  literal_0: bits[32] = literal(value=0)
  literal_1: bits[1] = literal(value=1)
  elem_0: bits[32] = invoke(literal_0, to_apply=mapper)
  eq_12: bits[1] = eq(literal_0, elem_0)
  ret and_13: bits[1] = and(eq_12, literal_1)
}
```

Here, it's trivial for a human reader to see that the results are the same; the
output should be equal to 1. Z3, however, reports that this is not necessarily
the case, suggesting that `literal_0` and `elem_0` would not be equal in the
case where the input to `mapper` was 1...which is clearly never the case here.

To address this, we require that all subroutines (including those used in maps
and counted fors) be inlined before consumption by Z3.
