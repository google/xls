// This pass will act upon a Proc that contains a single CountedFor node. The
// goal is to move the state for the CountedFor node into the Proc state, and
// adjusting the data flow to allow the CountedFor loop (and hence the proc) to
// iterate the required number of times before placing any result on the output
// channel. The driving example is the proc_fir_filter found in xls/examples.

// In the FIR filter's case, the CountedFor is responsible for the convolution
// (multiply-accumulate). Left alone, the CountedFor would be unrolled by
// trip_count times. This translates into that many duplicate blocks of
// hardware. As multipliers are particularly large and expensive IPs, it is
// often good to minimize how many there are. By rolling the CountedFor into
// the proc state, we end up with only a single multiplier, which can be a
// nice area and power consumption optimization.
