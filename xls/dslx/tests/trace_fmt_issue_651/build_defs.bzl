"""Convenience macro for tests that need to generate a JIT wrapper for a DSLX file.

Note: these are not user-facing, these are just for convenience of internal
development in specifying the various targets we may need as part of defining a DSLX
language-level test.

    Generate a JIT wrapper for a function in a DSLX file, for testing purposes.

    In the BUILD file you declare the wrapper target and then depend on it from
    the cc_test target:

        xls_dslx_ir_wrapper(
            name = "trace_u21_hex_wrapper",
        )

        native.cc_test(
            name = "trace_fmt_test",
            srcs = ["trace_fmt_test.cc"],
            deps = [
                ":trace_u21_hex_wrapper",
            ...

    Then, in a test file you import the generated wrapper and use it to run the DSLX function:

        #include "xls/dslx/tests/trace_fmt_issue_651/trace_[name]_wrapper.h"
        XLS_ASSERT_OK_AND_ASSIGN(auto trace, wrapped::[name]::Create());

    Args:
      name: The base name of the target, also the name of the `dslx_top` function.
      library: The `xls_dslx_library` rule that contains the DSLX file.

    cc_xls_ir_jit_wrapper(
