// Implements rounding for all rounding modes defined by the IEEE 754 standard.
//
// It handles unsigned, signed (two's complement), and sign-and-magnitude values.
// It handles all 5 IEEE 754 rounding modes.
// Versions with compile-time 'num bits rounded' argument are provided, truncating the rounded-away
// bits.
// Versions with runtime 'num bits rounded' argument are provided, returning the full-width rounded
// result, with the rounded-away bits zeroed.
//
// Note: XLS prunes unused specializations. If callers pass compile-time constants for
// `num_bits_rounded` or restrict `RoundingMode` via an adapter, the optimizer keeps only the
// cases that remain reachable. (E.g. wrap this API with your own enum of three rounding modes
// and convert to `RoundingMode`, then the others will fold away.)
//
// Let's say you only want 3 rounding modes. Your public API should be a new enum with only
// those 3 rounding modes, and a function that takes that enum, and translates it to the
// RoundingMode enum of this library. XLS optimizer will remove the unused rounding modes from
// the optimized code.

// Note that the first two (RNE, RNA) always round to the nearest value, and when two potential
// results are equally close, a tie-breaking rule is applied. The last three (RTZ, RTN, RTP)
// first establish a direction on the Extended Real number line, and then round to the nearest
// value in that direction. If there is a closer value in the opposite direction, it is never
// returned.
//
// On naming: those that round to the nearest value begin with "RN", and those that always round
// in the same direction begin with "RT".
pub enum RoundingMode : u3 {

    // result's lsb is 0.

    // value with the larger magnitude is returned.

// Rounds off the `num_bits_rounded` least significant bits. Returns (overflow, rounded result).
//
// Works for:
// - unsigned integers
//   - `sign` must be `NonNegative` (otherwise you have the sign-and-magnitude case, see below)
// - signed (two's complement) integers
//   - `sign` is ignored. The most significant bit of `unrounded` is used to determine the sign.
// - sign and magnitude values
//   - `sign` must be `Negative` when the represented value is a negative number, otherwise
//     `sign` must be `NonNegative`
//   - rounding may produce a zero magnitude from a negative input; callers must decide whether
//     to keep or flip the sign in that case
//
// The `num_bits_rounded` lsbs of the rounded result will always be 0.
//
// Users should interpret `unrounded` as a fixed-point quantity with num_bits_rounded fractional
// bits, being rounded to an integer. For unsigned inputs the corresponding Real value is
// unrounded / 2^num_bits_rounded, and the IEEE-754 rounding modes apply directly to that Real
// number. This viewpoint also explains the RNE tie case when every retained bit is discarded:
// the surviving integer portion is zero (an even value), so ties resolve towards zero.
//
// Overflow is 1 when the Real rounded result isn't a representable result (because the increase
// in magnitude requires a wider result type). Some non-exhaustive examples of when that can
// occur:
//  * RNE(3.5) = 4 -> overflow when round(RNE, 2, NonNegative, u4:0b11_10)
//  * RTN(-1.0625) = -2 -> overflow when round(RTN, 4, Negative, u5:0b1_0001)
//  * RTN(-0.03125) = -1 -> overflow when round(RTN, 5, NonNegative, s5:0b11111)
// The rounded result is 0 when overflow is 1.
//
// When num_bits_rounded > N, all source bits are treated as fractional. The rounded integer is 0
// unless the rounding mode requires +/-1, in which case overflow is signaled and 0 is returned.
//
// As mentioned above, during a tie, RNE looks at the least significant retained bit to
// determine round up or down. When there are no retained bits (i.e. num_bits_rounded >= N),
// round down is chosen. E.g.
// round(RNE, 4 bits, unsigned, u5:0b1_1000) -> rounds up (retained msb is 1)
// round(RNE, 4 bits, unsigned, u4:0b1000) -> rounds down (no retained bits)
