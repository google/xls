This file receives an integer from --n and an integer from --chains, and creates an
smt2 file containing an (n)-bit multiplier equivalence proof with (chains) nested
mul operations. For example, to create an smt2 file for 4-bit multiplication and
5 nested mul operations, we can run (after building)

$ bazel-bin/xls/experimental/smtlib/n_bit_nested_mul_generator --n=4 --chains=5

Once an smt2 file is created, we can run:

$ <solver command> <filename>

The created smt2 file asserts that the multiplier and the builtin multiplication DO NOT
produce the same result, so the output we expect to see is:

$ unsat

meaning the multiplier and the builtin multiplication never produce different
results. They are logically equivalent.
