This file contains helper functions for testing solvers on smt2 files.

get_solver_file_speed_ms takes in a solver and a file. It tests the solver 10 times
on the file (raising an error if the solver doesn't produce the expected result),
and reutrn the average time (in milliseconds) the 10 tests took.

get_solver_speeds_ms takes in a list of solvers and a list of files. It tests each
solver on each of the files using get_solver_file_speed_ms, and returns a list of
lists containing the average speed for each of the files, for each of the solvers.
