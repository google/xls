This file contains a function that takes in a csv file and plots the data in within it.

This file is meant to be used in conjunction with solvers_op_comparison_bits_list.py and
solvers_op_comparison_nests_list.py. Those two files produce the data as csv files, and
this file reads that data and plots it.

This file takes in three flags:

--fname: the csv file containing the data you would like to plot (required)

--xscale: the x-axis scale, 'linear' by default

--yscale: the y-axis scale, 'linear' by default
