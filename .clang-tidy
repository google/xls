# readability-make-member-function-const is great, but it also suggests that
#    in cases where we return a non-const pointer. So good to check, not by
#    default.
#
# readability-qualified-auto is useful in general, however it suggests
#    to convert iterators (e.g. std::string_view::begin()) to the pointer it
#    returns; however since the iterator is implementation defined, this is not
#    a valid assertion. Running the check every now and then manually and
#    fixing all the non-iterator cases is useful though. Off by default.
#
# misc-const-correctness: useful, but it seems to be overzealous at times,
#    arriving at incorrect conclusions.
#
# modernize-make-unique: mostly correct, but wants to also replace .reset()
#    which is a more readable way than assign.
# NOTE: Below, there must be no comments, otherwise clang tidy silently ignores
#       rules... (ask me how I know).
