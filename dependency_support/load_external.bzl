"""Provides helper that loads external repositories with third-party code."""

# TODO: https://github.com/google/xls/issues/931 - all the remaining toplevel projects we need should move to MODULE.bazel,
# somewhat dependent on what becomes available in https://registry.bazel.build/.
# Eventual goal that none of this is needed anymore and the file can be removed.

    # Note: there are more direct dependencies than are explicitly listed here.
    #
    # By letting direct dependencies be satisfied by transitive WORKSPACE
    # setups we let the transitive dependency versions "float" to satisfy their
    # package requirements, so that we can bump our dependency versions here
    # more easily without debugging/resolving unnecessary conflicts.
    #
    # This situation will change when XLS moves to bzlmod. See
