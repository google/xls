# Invocation without parameters simply uses the .clang-tidy config to run on
# all *.{cc,h} files. Additional parameters passed to this script are passed
# to clang-tidy as-is. Typical use could be for instance
#   run-clang-tidy-cached.sh --checks="-*,modernize-use-override" --fix

# We have to first build the binary, then build the compilation-db and
# must not call "bazel run" below ... otherwise bazel will remove some
# of the symbolic links to external dependencies that we carefully
# establish with the compilation-db build.
