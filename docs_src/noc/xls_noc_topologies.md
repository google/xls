# XLS-NoC Topologies

The network topology is the static arrangement of router nodes, channels, and
endpoints in a network. The document will describe the logical representation of
common topology types and define the communication flow within the topology. At
the physical level, the arrangement of the topology influences the floorplan,
layout and packaging.

The supported set of topologies types are:

*   [Dimension Order](xls_noc_dimension_order_topology.md)
*   [Tree](xls_noc_tree_topology.md)
*   [k-ary n-fly Butterfly](xls_noc_butterfly_topology.md)
*   [Fully Connected](xls_noc_fully_connected_topology.md)
*   [Star](xls_noc_star_topology.md)
