# XLS-NoC Project

The XLS-NoC subproject is a project that leverages XLS's facilities for
optimizing parameterized hardware designs in the realm of NoC generation.

A declarative specification drives the NoC generation process for optimization
(e.g. of performance/area tradeoffs), traffic simulations and software-level
functional verification, and the creation of (System)Verilog RTL artifacts such
as routers and network-interfacing adapter components.
